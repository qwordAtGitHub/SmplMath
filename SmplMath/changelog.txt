10.02.2012  Version 2.0.0
            added:       - Back end macro-interface introduced.
                           The different instruction sets (x86-integer,FPU,SSE2/FPU) are implemented in so called back ends.
                           A back end consist of macros that are called by the fSlv-macros when a specific operation
                           is requested. The main advatage is that the back ends does not need to interpret the parser's result.
                           Also, the back end can be dynamically changed.
                         - x64-support (JWASM only)
                           The macros assumes:
                              - to be called from .code-section
                              - that the stack is align to 16 and the shadow space (MS-FASTCALL) is allocated (32 Bytes)
                              - to be allowed to use the shadowspace
                           The macros take care of the FASTCALL calling convention (Microsoft) and does only use 
                           the XMM registers XMM0-XMM5. However, the used registers can be changed using
                           the fSlvVolatileXmmRegs-macro.
                           As for x32, no GPR is modified (unless fSlvVolatileGPReg is used to mark them as volatile).
                         - SSE2 support
                           The SSE2 instruction set can be enabled by setting the global flag FSF_USE_SSE2
                           or by using the fSlvSelectBackEnd-macro. For x64, SSE2 is used by default.
                           The SSE2-back end use the FPU, if there is no SSE2 implentation for the requested operation.
                           Currently this applies to exponential, logarithm and trigonometric functions.
                         - the function-descriptor-macro and it's code producing counterpart has been extended
                           to fit the new requirements.
                         - Static library (x32): \macros\SmplMath\lib\x32\SmplMath.lib
                         - Static library (x64): \macros\SmplMath\lib\x64\SmplMath.lib
                         - root2(x,a,b) : x^(a/b), a&b = integers
                         - fTest-macro: test for zero
                         - internal: fpu_is_integer-function
                         - rsqrtss(x) (SSE2, REAL4 only): 1/sqrt(x), error less equal 1.5*2^-12
                         - rcpss(x) (SSE2, REAL4 only): 1/x, error less equal 1.5*2^-12
                         - expd(x) (SSE2/REAL8 only): approximation of e^x, error less than 4.0E-14
                         - typedef: BOOLEAN_BYTE
                         - macro: - fSlvVolatileXmmRegs
                                  - fSlvLoadBackEnd
                                  - fSlvSelectBackEnd
                                  - fSlvVolatileGPReg
                                  - fSlvI64()
                         - new global flags: FSF_USE_FPU, FSF_USE_SSE2
                         - macro: fSlvRegRecursiveExpr: allows to register recursive expressions
                         - floating point values can be specified in hexadecimal notation. e.g: 3F800000r
                         - include file: expressions.inc : contains some predefined expressions. (not included by math.inc)


            improvement: - acos, asin, root, log() and ln() revised
                         - @IsInteger/real support edx::eax
                         - x64 support for all existing functions
                         - SSE2 implementations for the functions:
                           sqrt,abs,rad,deg,limit,min,max,sgn
                         - predefined expressions: - arguments begining with # are treated as expressions that can be solved by MASM's preprocessor.
                                                   - common macro function can be called. The macro name must have
                                                     the "?$"-prefix. e.g.: ?$macroFnc(...). Because the macros are called
                                                     in context of the parser, code generation is forbidden.
                           

            change:      - the exponentation operator "^" has been changed (fpu_st1_pow_st0):
                           For negative bases, the function checks if the exponent is an integer value.
                           In this case the result's signe is changed, if the exponent is odd.
                           The result for negativ bases in combination with a non-integer exponents is allways positiv.
                           Also the function respons to some special values: 0^0=1, x^0=1, 0^x=0, 0^(-x)=div. by zero
                         - the macros support multiple, comma seperated expressions.
                         - the __MODULE__-constant is gone out of use.
                         - constant integer expressions (+-*/^) may be calculated while assembling if the local intger size is 4
                           and the result is also an integer.
                         - constant rvalues for division may be replaced by a multiplication with the reciprocal (implemented in the back ends)
                         - the macros R4/8/10 are renamed for x64: _R4/8/10. For x32, corresponding EQU's added.
                         - function-descriptor: FNCD_USES_SSE has been removed!
                         - The Paser does handle assignments "="
                         - @ScanForFlt(): - GOTO-constructs replaced by corresponding IF/ENDIF constructs.
                                            The resaon is that MASM (all versions) somtimes get "confused" with nested macros that
                                            use the GOTO directives. A typical error is A2002, "... cannot have more than one ELSE clause per IF block".
                                          - the macro now support FP values written in hexadecimal notation (with R-suffix).
                           

            bugfix:      - fSlv rejects variables named "s"
                         - @TrimStr() did not work correct for arguments with commas.
                         - function calls with one (non-constant) argument fails due a bug in fslv_call_fnc().
                           This bug was hidden/bypassed by the faulty implimentation of @TrimStr().
                         - regx_oprt_reg0: fxch before exponentation
                         - The parser may emit missplaced "push" tokens.
                         - negativ signs may be discarded for constant expressions like: 1-1.0 -> 1+1.0

            misc.:       - GOTO has been removed from all macros becasue it simply cause to strange errors (for all version of MASM)

            added:       - @fSlvTSA()-macro: preliminary version, not documented

            improvement: If __MODULE__ is defined, the SmplMath-includes does not create code or
                         constants. Instead EXTERNDEFs and PROTOs are used.This is needed for 
                         modular programing. Example:
                         ...
                         __MODULE__ TEXTEQU <>
                         include \macros\SmplMath\math.inc
